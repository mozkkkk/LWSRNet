# LWSRNet
A lightweight method for change detection

## Usage

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be found using a standard web search.

### Training

To train the model from scratch, you can run the `train.py` script. Key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs can be configured directly within the script.

```bash
python train.py
```
### Testing and Predicting

To evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset and calculate key metrics (e.g., mIoU, etc). This will output the performance scores and can also save the visual prediction maps for analysis.

```bash
python test.py
```
